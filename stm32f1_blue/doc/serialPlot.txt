
First, when in custom frame mode, you shouldn’t use printf function. Printf converts numbers to text, in binary mode you should send them directly. I don’t know what library you are using but you should have a function to send data byte by byte. Let’s say we have a function named uart_send(uint8_t data) that sends 1 byte from uart. In this case you would send the frame start with this:
uart_send(0xFF);
Second, you don’t send number of channels as part of the frame. Maybe I should add this as an option. But it is not supported at the moment.
Third, if you select the ‘Fixed Size’ option you don’t send the payload size as part of the frame, you should set it in the SerialPlot interface only.
Here is a complete example (I’m assuming you have a function named `uart_send`):


float temp[10];
uint8_t* data = (uint8_t*) temp; // type casting for ease of access

uart_send(0xFF); // send frame start

uart_send(40); // payload size, remove this line if 'fixed size' option is selected

// send samples array byte by byte
for (int i = 0; i < 40; i++) { uart_send(data[i]); }

I hope this is helpful.
